This program was built to create a video game space shooter when you shoot down asteroids in 
order to excavate power stars. According to legend you need to collect 7 power stars to make 
your wildest dreams come true. Power Stars reside within asteroids, but sometimes 
they can contain hibernating aliens who will attack when awoken during slumber.
