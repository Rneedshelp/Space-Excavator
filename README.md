This program was built to create a video game space shooter when you shoot down asteroids in 
order to excavate power stars. According to legend you need to collect 7 power stars to make 
your wildest dreams come true. Power Stars reside within asteroids, but sometimes 
they can contain hibernating aliens who will attack when awoken during slumber.

RUNNING THE GAME:
This program was created in the Gedit text editor and under the Python 2.7.12 language
After downloading all the files into the same directory, make sure each is in the same path/folder that
holds all the sub folders inside. 
Open up the terminal and use these two commands to play the game:
1.) cd SpaceExcavator
2.) python SpaceExcavator.py
FEATURES and BUGS:
The program has active buttons that use that can select. Includes a quit option, controls page, and 
start game button. The program features music, images, and sounds borrowed from other video games 
such as Star Fox and Metroid. All rights to these sounds, images, and music belong to Nintendo, and 
their distributors. The program also features a score keeper to keep track of the points scored by 
destroying the asteroids. Depending on the size of the asteroid you will get more points the larger 
the asteroid. If you reach 1500 points, you gain the ability to make your lasers travel at double 
the speed. If you reach 3000 points you gain the ability to shoot at a faster rate. The program utilizes
a random brain by calculating a random positon for which the asteroid will appear in. There is no 
pattern to which the asteroids will appear or drop from. I implemented a random generator to calculate 
a random position on the screen the asteroid will appear in. An animation is played when you destroy
an asteroid, or when you crash into an alien, or rock. Sounds play when you shoot, destroy an asteroid, 
and collect a power star. One thing that is not a bug but is important in working the game is the 
directory of the files used. If you want to use the images and sounds please change the directories 
according to your appropriate username. For example: All the files used in code are implemented like this “/home/username/SpaceExcavator/Images/samus.png” Please replace ‘username’ with the username on 
your computer to have full access to the files.



CONTRIBUTES AND REFERENCES:
All images and sounds belong to Nintendo, and I hold no ownership of any of these images or sounds.
